## Key Insights ( for me to do) look at data and see what you can discern

They should keep promoting Weekend Music, keeping pushing that artist music,

While sitting outside, I literally heard 3 Weekends songs, so keeping that 
as central song in the Core playlists, should keep listener renention.
It is a apparoiate song for most listeners.

Weekends Best Year was 2016 & 2019. With an average of 3.13 billion.
With Blinding linds and Starboy leading the push.

Something I would also be curious about what songs, are played in the background 
the most, like songs as background, like what the people are doing while listening to song.

A close second would also be Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi with the songs Shape of You, Someone You Loved, and Perfect.
The years the domained market share was 2017 and 2018.




## Conclusion (      )

In conclusion 2017 & 2016 was strong time for Spotify , with High number of streams. With the following years, not
being able to maintain that same high, but thus allowing new artists to come and bring in new streams in the following years.
